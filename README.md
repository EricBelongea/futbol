# Futbol

We plan to check in at least once per day. Or as feels necessary/logical.

We plan to use [Github Projects](https://github.com/users/zkevkev/projects/1/views/1) as our project organization framework. We plan to either pair coding using Tuple or work independently utilizing Github branching. This will allow for synchronous and asyncronous work.

We will begin by looking at a initial tests and example methods as a group, to identify challenges and direct workflow. Next, we are going to work indivually and in pairs to write the initial implementation code. We will then come back together, working synchronously on Tuple to discuss refactoring objectives. This will allow for all contributer's expertise when refactoring and we will all be able to learn from one another's insights.

Make it work. Make it good. Make it fast. In seriousness, we plan to write functional code and then use red to green refactoring.
